This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Setting up Authentication and API access

Create a `.env.local` file by copying the `.env.example` file and set the following environment variables:

- Create a free account on [Dynamic Labs](https://app.dynamic.xyz/) and get your environment id (NEXT_PUBLIC_ENVIRONMENT_ID)
  - You will need to enable Solana with a RPC for the Eclipse Bridge to work.

- Create a free account on [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/) and get your API key (ETHERSCAN_API_KEY)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
